Assalamualaikum w.b.t.

There are no greater gifts on my birthday than a simple and sincere act of reciting Al-Fatiha and sadaqah (voluntary charity) for dearly beloved Allahyarhamah [Salmi Syahirah](http://www.amischaheera.com/), [@amischaheera](http://instagram.com/amischaheera).

Let us pray for her and expect the best from God.  
May her soul rest in peace, and she find love in the arms of God, InsyaAllah.  

Ameen.

About 4 and a half-years ago, 2 weeks into the marriage, Ami was pronounced ill of Acute Myeloid Leukemia. It was shocking, devastating, grieving and shattering circumstance for the both of us, of course. 

3 and a half-months later on her birthday I sang this song to her. 

In that difficult time we both ‘redha’ and accepted that, together shall we endure, the test that God had made us bear.

Today, 7 and a half-months after her departure, here I stand alone for the first time in 12 years, on my birthday without her presence. 

Again, I guess, the same song is still relevant, not for her now but for me.

Stop Crying Your Heart Out  
By Oasis  

Hold up  
Hold on  
Don't be scared  
You'll never change what's been and gone  

May your smile (may your smile)  
Shine on (shine on)  
Don't be scared (don't be scared)  
Your destiny may keep you warm  

Cos all of the stars  
Are fading away  
Just try not to worry  
You'll see them some day  
Take what you need  
And be on your way  
And stop crying your heart out  

Get up (get up)  
Come on (come on)  
Why're you scared? (I'm not scared)  
You'll never change  
What's been and gone  

Cos all of the stars  
Are fading away  
Just try not to worry  
You'll see them some day  
Take what you need  
And be on your way  
And stop crying your heart out  

Cos all of the stars  
Are fading away  
Just try not to worry  
You'll see them some day  
Take what you need  
And be on your way  
And stop crying your heart out  

We're all of us stars  
We're fading away  
Just try not to worry  
You'll see us some day  
Just take what you need  
And be on your way  
And stop crying your heart out  
Stop crying your heart out  
Stop crying your heart out  
```
