i opened a wound in the earth  
to tuck you away  

and as the soil filled around you  
covering the last of my dreams  

i asked the roots  
and the rocks  
and the oceans  
and the sea  
to collapse around me  

so i could lay by your side  
*one last time.*

P/S: Today if you are still around, just 9 days after you went away, marks the 4th year of our journey into the marriage. I miss you so much Salmi Syahirah.
