Assalamualaikum w.b.t.  

It has been almost 5 months since [Ami](http://www.amischaheera.com/) left us.  
Some of us still remember her, some still miss her.  
As for me, her smile, her face, her lovely voice,  
her gentle touch and her kindness will truly be missed;  
she'll always be in my heart.

If she's still around, today will be her 30th. birthday. 
I'm taking this opportunity to humbly ask you,  
friends and families, to place du'a and recite Al-Fatihah for her.  

I hope Allah puts her amongst the righteous  
and she's doing fine on the other side.  

Thanks a lot everyone.  
Alhamdulillah.  
May god bless us all.  
Amin.
