Assalamualaikum and good day.

Dear families and friends.

The past twelve days have been the toughest time in my life.

Ami fell ill and was admitted to Hospital Ampang for five days with breathing
difficulties. On the fifth day, with her white blood cell count spiking up and
her lungs slowly failing due to an infection, she laid a little uneasy in her
bed, surrounded by close family members. On Wednesday, 24 Jamadil Awwal in the
1435th year of the Hijrah, March 26th, 2014 at 01:30 in the morning, she was
pronounced dead. She was 29 years old.

Her cause of death was Relapsed [Acute Myeloid
Leukemia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia)

*__Let us pray for her and expect the best from Godâ€¦__*

Beloved Families, Friends, Boys and Girls.

For those who prayed and cared for her,<br />
those who showed love and kindness,<br />
those who called and came to visit,<br />
those who supported and donated money,<br />

I appreciate your sympathy, concern, wishes and prayers. I can't thank you all
enough. May God bless you and your families.

>From the (earth) did We create you, and into it shall We return you, and
from it shall We bring you out once again.

><small>(Al-Quran 20:55)</small>

<br />

>The Prophet Muhammad taught that three things continue to benefit a
[believing] person even after death - charity which he/she had given (which
continues to benefit others), beneficial knowledge which he/she had left
behind (authored or taught), and supplication on his/her behalf by a righteous
child.

><small>(Sahih Muslim)</small>

*__May her soul rest in peace, and she find love in the arms of God...__*
