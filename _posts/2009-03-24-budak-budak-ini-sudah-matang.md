> TODAY, I received a text sms from Kutel.

> "Kau tak join dinner 21st nih?"  
> "Dinner apa ek?" I replied.  
> "Check email. 10 years celebration at Tupai-tupai restaurant."  

> I'm fortunate & lucky to have great bond, full with loyalties of what I called 'best buddies'. A feeling or attitude of devoted attachment and affection is pure, which made me feel that wealth & influence should not be used as criteria for making friends.

> I came to realize the importance of being amiable, courteous, and sincere in dealing with people when I was in high school or to more precise - in a boarding school. I was studying in a school located in the center of Ipoh, Perak, called STAR or Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman from 1995 to 1999.

> Itâ€™s been 10 years since we left school & 15 years still in contact with former schoolmates through hard, tough times.

> ####The best antiques are old friends...

> Oh yes. I agree. It takes a long time to grow an old friend.
